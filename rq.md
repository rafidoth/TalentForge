# Idea
You have to implement *a Web application for CV management system* (different positions, experience, skills, etc.). Users define "*positions*" with the set of attributes. Position is a kind of template for CVs; other users fill their CVs for the related positions with specific values. Three of the most important features are customisable positions with arbitrary attributes, reusable library of attributes, and automatic CV generation.

E.g., a Recruiter creates a "Business Analyst" positions, adds the "English Level"  dropdown attribute and the number-valued field "GPA". Some candidates fill out English levels and GPAs in their profiles and generate CVs tailored for the given positon. Then recruiters browse the CVs to find appropriate candidate.

# Warning
If your app have N buttons (view/edit/delete in _each_ record), your result will be graded -20%. Use toolbars, or animated "appearing" context actions, etc.

This is forbidden:
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬ ┬────────────────┐   
│ Name        │ Position        │…│                │   
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼ ┼────────────────┤   
│ Smith, John │ Data Scientist  │…│ [Edit][Delete] │
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼ ┼────────────────┤   
│ King, Paul  │ DevOps Engineer │…│ [Edit][Delete] │ 
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼ ┼────────────────┤   
                        …                     
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼ ┼────────────────┤ 
│ Morris, Lee │ QA Engineer     │…│ [Edit][Delete] │   
└─────────────┴─────────────────┴ ┴────────────────┘ 
```
This is OK:
```
[Delete]
   
 ⍰  𝗡𝗮𝗺𝗲 v        𝗣𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻               𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹             
─────────────────────────────────────────────  
 ☐  King, Paul    DevOps Engineer     Junior
 
 ☑  Morris, Lee   QA Engineer         Senior
 
 ☐  Smith, John   D͟a͟t͟a͟ ͟S͟c͟i͟e͟n͟t͟i͟s͟t͟      Middle 
                    ☝ 
```
Positions, as well as CVs, should be displayed in the table views. 

The usage "tile" / "gallery" representation will be graded -20%.

This is wrong:
```
┌────────────────┐ ┌────────────────┐   
│ 👤 Morris, Lee    │ │ 👤 Smith, John     │ 
│ [𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄]              │ │ [𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄]               │
└────────────────┘ └────────────────┘
┌────────────────┐   
│ 👤 King, Paul     │ 
│ [𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄]              │
└────────────────┘  
```
> You have to use table representation for positions and CVs, not ~~gallery~~ or ~~tiles~~.

Every page provides access to full-text search via the top header. 

> Implement a convenient consistent navigation int your app.


# Overview
The system is a web-based recruitment platform that allows Candidates to maintain reusable professional profiles and generate tailored CVs for positions managed by Recruiters.

The platform is built around three "killer-featues":
* Reusable Attribute Library – attributes can be defined once and reused across multiple positions and CVs;
* Customizable Position Templates – Recruiters can build position-specific CV templates using attributes from the library;
* Automatically Generated CVs – CVs are assembled dynamically from candidate profile data and position requirements.

The platform supports three user roles:
* Candidate;
* Recruiter;
* Administrator.


# Authentication and Authorization
Non-authenticated users may:
* Register an account;
* Sign in;
* Browse available positions in read-only mode;
* View public statistics (for example, "10 new CVs created in the last 24 hours").

Non-authenticated users may not: create or edit positions, browse or create CVs, post comment or like CVs, access personal pages.

Users can authenticate using social login providers (at minimum, the platform must support two).<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> The good options are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Google</mark> and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Facebook</mark>, but you may choose others.</mark>


# Roles
Candidates can:
* Manage their personal profile;
* Select and fill attributes from the attribute library;
* Manage project descriptions;
* View positions available to them;
* Create and edit CVs for positions they are allowed to access (if Candidates loose the access, the filled out CVs are hidden);
* Participate in discussions.

Candidates may access only their own profile and CVs.

All Recruiters share responsibility for the same set of positions. Any Recruiter can modify any position, there is no concept of position ownership. Also, all Recruiters manage the shared pool of attributes.

Any Recruiter can:
* Create positions;
* Duplicate existing positions;
* Edit positions;
* Delete positions;
* Configure access rules;
* Manage position templates;
* Manage the attribute library;
* View candidate CVs in read-only mode (using full-text search, accessing CVs through the position or through the personal pages);
* Participate in discussions;
* Like CVs.

Administrators have unrestricted access. Admins have full access and can view all pages as if they were the owner. For example, an Admin can open a candidate's page, fix typos, edit attributes, or make any other changes—effectively acting as the owner of every personal page.

Administrators can:
* View all pages;
* Edit any candidate profile;
* Edit any CV;
* Edit any position;
* Perform all Recruiter actions;
* Perform all Candidate actions;
* Manage users (viewing, blocking, unblocking, deleting, assigning roles, removing roles).

> Administrators may remove their own Administrator role.


# Personal Profile
Each authenticated user has a personal profile page. Only the profile owner and Administrators may edit or view the full profile.

Recruiters cannot access profile editing and only see CV data as read-only page.

The profile consists of four sections:
## Me
Contains mandatory built-in attributes. These fields always exist and cannot be removed. E.g., First Name, Last Name, Location, Personal Photo. These attributes should be build on the same "engine" (e.g., can be added to position template), but cannot be removed by Recruiters.
## Info
Contains user-selected attributes from the Attribute Library.

Candidates may:
* Add or remove attributes from the library;
* Fill values for those attributes.

E.g., IELTS Score, Presentation Skills, Remote Work Availability.
## Projects
Candidates may maintain a list of projects.

Each project contains:
* Name
* Period (date range).
* Description (with Markdown formatting).
* Technology Tags (support autocompletion for the tags prevously entered; use a nice UI component  for the tags).

Projects can be added, edited, and removed.
## CVs
Displays all CVs created by the Candidate. A Candidate may have at most one CV per position. Existing CVs can be edited or deleted. New CVs may be created only for positions accessible to the Candidate. Each CV entry acts as a link to the corresponding CV page.


# Auto-Save
Personal profile pages support automatic saving:
* Changes are tracked locally;
* Changes are saved every 5–10 seconds;
* Saving must not occur on every keystroke;
* The auto-save mechanism must use optimistic locking.

The system must use <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">optimistic locking</mark>. Each save operation (for attributes, positions and auto-saves of profiles):
* Sends the current version number;
* Updates the record if the version matches;
* Returns a new version number;
* Fails if the version has changed.

The client must handle version conflicts gracefully.


# Killer Feature #1: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Attribute Library</mark>
The Attribute Library enables reusable structured data across profiles, positions, and CVs.

All Recruiters can: create attributes, edit attributes, delete attributes.

Each attribute contains:
* Category—one from a predefined list;
* Name—globally unique attribute name;
* Attribute data type.

Examples of categories: Certification, Domain Knowledge, Personal Information, Soft Skills.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Supported Attribute Types:</mark>
* String (single-line plain text);
* Text (Markdown-formatted text);
* Image (an external cloud storage service by drag-n-drop);
* Numeric;
* Date;
* Period (date range);
* Boolean (checkbox);
* One of many (dropdown).

Because the library may become large, attribute selection must support:
* Lookup by prefix;
* Recently used attributes;
* Category filtering.


# Killer Feature #2: Positions
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Positions serve as customizable CV templates.</mark>

All Recruiters manage a shared list of positions. A Recruiter may:
* Create a blank position or duplicate an existing position;
* Edit any position;
* Delete any position.

Each position contains:
* Basic information, incl. Title and Short Description;
* Access Rules (a position may be either public (accessible to all authenticated users) or restricted using filters);
* Attributes selected from the Attribute Library;
* Project tags (for selecting relevant projects) as well maximum number of projects included in the generated CV.

Examples of access rules:
* "IELTS Score" numeric value is > 7.0;
* "Remote Work" checkbox is checked;
* "Presentation Skills" value in dropdown = "Advanced".

Available filter operators depend on attribute type.

Each position provide the list of the CVs created from that position (accessible by Recruits and Administrators only).

Candidates may create CVs only for positions they are authorized to access. If Candidate looses the access, the already created CVs aren't deleted, they are hidden in UI.


# Killer Feature #3: CV Generation
CVs are generated automatically from:
* Candidate profile data (undeletable attributes like name);
* Selected library attributes (values are either fetched automatically from the attributes set by Candidate);
* Candidate projects (filtered).

When CV is created from a position, the attributes from the position are added to the profile (if necessary; some may be already filled out); the auto-added values are empty by default.

The generated CV should:
* Be professionally formatted;
* Be divided into clearly structured sections;
* Display only relevant information (attributes specified in the position and filtered projects).

When a Candidate opens own CV:
* Attributes are pre-filled automatically from the profile.
* Missing information can be entered manually in-place;

> Each attribute in the CV can be edited in place (the only one common master value for attirbute is stored in the profile). If value is empty it's highlighted in red color.

Editing a attribute in a CV _modified the original profile value_.

Recruiters can only view CVs in rendered read-only mode; the empty values are highlighed in red. They cannot directly modify candidate CVs (Administrators can).




# Discussions
Each position contains a Discussion tab. Discussion posts include: author name, timestamp, text content (Markdown-formatted).

If page is viewed by Recruiters, the author name links to the user's public profile view.

Posts are displayed in chronological order. New posts are always appended to the end, posts cannot be inserted between existing posts. Updates should appear for all active viewers within 2–5 seconds (implementation may use WebSockets, Polling or whatever),

# Likes
Each CV supports likes.

Only Recruiters may like CVs. One Recruiter may give at most one like to a specific CV. A Recruiter may remove their like. The total number of likes is displayed in the CV lists and inn search results.

# Main Page
The main page contains:
* Latest Positions (table showing the most recently created or updated positions);
* Most Popular Positions (top 5 positions ranked by the number of submitted CVs);
* Tag Cloud with technology tags (linked to CVs for Recruiters or positions for Candidates);
* Statistics (e.g., number if CVs created in the last 24 hours, total number of positions, total number of Candidates, total number of Recruiters, total number of submitted CVs).


# More
The application should support two UI languages: English and one additional language (e.g., Polish, Spanish, Uzbek, Georgian, etc.). The user selects the language, and their choice is saved. _Only the UI is translated_ — user-generated content such as project descriptions or names is not translated.

The application should also support two visual themes: light and dark. The user selects the theme, and their choice is saved.

***Requirements***:
* Use a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap — or any other framework and set of UI controls you prefer);
* Support responsive design for various screen sizes and resolutions, including mobile phones;
* Use an ORM (e.g., Sequelize, Prisma, TypeORM, Entity Framework — any is acceptable);
* Use a full-text search engine, either through an external library or native database features.

***DON'T***s:
* Don’t perform full database scans using raw SELECT * queries;
* Don’t upload images to your web server or database;
* Don’t execute database queries inside loops;
* Don't add buttons in the table rows.

> Is it possible to use the X library? ***Yes***, yes to all — remember my choice.



# Optional Requirements
For a separate grade—only if all the core requirements are fully implemented:
* Generate printable documents in PDF formats with QR codes linked back to the app;
* Implement form authentication with email confirmation as an alternative to social network authentication;
* Implement the system of "badges" or "achievements" (like "10 projects", or "5 CVs", or "25 likes"), generate a nice SVG panel on the profile page and allow to download it;
* Add additional "tuning" options to the fields, such as: text length limits, regex validators, value ranges for numeric fields, etc.
* Export from the CVs for the given position to a aggregate CSV/Excel file for analysis.
